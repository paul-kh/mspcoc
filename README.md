# About the Project

As a member of the Minneapolis-St. Paul Church of Christ, I created this project for rebuilding the church's website to be a responsive one. The church's current website displays great on desktop's screen but is not responsive on small screen.

* The church's current website: http://www.mspcoc.org/

## Development site

* Testing site: https://paul-kh.github.io/mspcoc/
